  summary:
    "I started my journey in [Electrical Engineering](#education), but somewhere between the realm of circuits and transistors, I stumbled upon programming â€” and it completely changed my path. What began as a small curiosity during my Higher Secondary days quickly turned into a full-blown passion. I started learning web development, and before I knew it, I was deep into [building products](#work), [solving tough engineering challenges](#projects), and [contributing to open source](#contributions). To know the science behind what I was building, I later pursued a [B.Tech in Computer Science](#education), which helped me bridge the gap between practical development and core computing concepts.",

        `[**Simplified Checkout**](https://www.besimplified.com/checkout/)

* Engineered a high-performance theme rendering service capable of serving thousands of admin-built checkout themes at over **100k requests/sec** by storing compiled templates in AWS S3 and using Redis-backed precomputed data.
* Reduced page render latency by **~80%** using a **size-based LRU cache** for compiled templates and AWS Sticky Sessions to minimize cache misses.
* Designed and implemented a **custom HTML templating language** leveraging comment directives and data attributes to inject dynamic data such as pricing, product details, and user information without disrupting markup integrity.
* Architected a **modular provider system** supporting seamless integration with multiple e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce) and CRMs (Sticky, CheckoutChamp, Vrio) through an auto-discoverable abstraction layer.
* Enhanced platform security with **brute-force protection**, **fraud detection**, and **intelligent traffic routing** mechanisms for A/B testing and performance monitoring.

**Simplified Core**

* Architected and developed a **unified backend framework** powering all Simplified products, providing **one-command CRUD generation** with built-in authentication (JWT), authorization (DAC model), and hook-based extensibility.
* Integrated **Kafka-based event streaming**, advanced query utilities (pagination, sorting, filtering, search), and structured logging for streamlined inter-service communication.
* Automated schema validation, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation generation to enforce standardization and consistency across microservices.
* Implemented **internationalization (i18n)** support, enabling all Simplified services to be multi-language ready.
* Adopted company-wide as the foundation for new product microservices, improving development velocity by **50%**, scalability, and maintainability.

[**Simplified HR**](https://www.besimplified.com/hr/)

* Designed and implemented an **automated leave crediting scheduler** capable of handling thousands of employees with retry, fallback, and failure notification mechanisms.
* Used **Google Cloud Tasks (GCT)** for distributed job handling and worker pools for concurrent credit computation, ensuring high availability and resilience.
* Built and maintained multiple HR modules, including **leave management**, **ticketing**, **employee tracking**, **notification system**, and **scheduler service**.
* Enhanced reliability and transparency by integrating alerting and logging mechanisms that notify administrators in case of critical failures or missed crediting events.`,
